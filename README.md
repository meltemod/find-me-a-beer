But how does **find me a beer** know what you will like? Glad you asked.

## We trust the opinions of the craft beer community!
Using [1.5 million beer reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/rdoume/beerreviews) from BeerAdvocate, this project generates a beer-to-beer review score network.

If reviewers who liked *Beer A* also liked *Beer B*, it's a match!
